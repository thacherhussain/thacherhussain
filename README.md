### Hello World 🌍

Hi! I'm Thacher (she/her). 

I am a frontend developer and UX designer, currently working mostly in React.

I'm currently open for work as a Frontend/UX Engineer. I just wrapped up working as a Frontend/UX Engineer at [Tidepool](http://www.tidepool.org).  For more information about my experience you can checkout my [LinkedIn Profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/thacherhussain) or [thacher.co](http://www.thacher.co)

You can reach me on Twitter [@thacherhussain](http://www.twitter.com/thacherhussain) or by email at [thacher.hussain@gmail.com](mailto:thacher.hussain@gmail.com)

Ask me about... learning React, testing, reafactoring and upgrading applications, going to/graduating from a software development bootcamp, working in the healthcare industry, diabetes technology, coffee, or my adorable tripod dog

Random Fact: My signature PR review sign-off is "LGTM 🦄"
